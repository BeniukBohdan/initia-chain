This repository hosts `initiad`, the first implementation of a cosmos zone with move smart contracts enabled.

## Documentation & Introduction

You can find an introduction to the Initia and how to use the initiad binary as a delegator, validator or node operator as well as how moveVM on the Initia works in the [documentation](https://app.gitbook.com/o/VC1Rsak51RJaeaQhM2YE/s/pUvrGia2zAh06hjawOb6/developers/initiad).

Alternatively, whether you're new to blockchain technology or interested in getting involved, the Initia [Tutorial](https://app.gitbook.com/o/f40ATI6dfRXMHEcAFnUO/s/rnGS4UFboF67ZTvcmbIH/tutorials) will guide you through everything. The tutorial walks you through the basics of blockchain technology, to interacting, creating your own smart contract, and beyond.

## Note Operators

If you're interested in running an node on the current Initia, check out the docs to [Run a Public Node](https://app.gitbook.com/o/VC1Rsak51RJaeaQhM2YE/s/pUvrGia2zAh06hjawOb6/node-operators/running-initia-node).

## Validators

If you want to participate and help secure Initia, check out becoming a validator. Information on what a validator is and how to participate as one can be found at the [documentation](https://app.gitbook.com/o/f40ATI6dfRXMHEcAFnUO/s/rnGS4UFboF67ZTvcmbIH/validators). If you're running a validator node on the Initia, reach out to a `TBD` on the Initia Developers Discord to join the #validators-verified channel.

## Delegators

If you still want to participate on the Initia, check out becoming a delegator. Information on what a delegator is and how to participate as one can be found at the [TBD](./).

## Contract Developers

If you want to build a move smart contract on Initia, check out becoming contract developer. Information on how to build and deploy contract can be found at the [documentation](https://app.gitbook.com/o/VC1Rsak51RJaeaQhM2YE/s/pUvrGia2zAh06hjawOb6/developers/contracts).

## Testnet

To participate in or utilize the current Initia testnet, take a look at the [initia/networks](https://github.com/initia-labs/networks) repository.
